# HUMINT Platform

A self-hosted case-management platform for human-source and open-source
intelligence work. Record people, organizations, locations, events, sources, communications, vehicles and documents; write reports and link them to what they
discuss; drop in documents and let a **local** model propose the entities and
relationships it finds — for you to accept or throw out.

OpenCTI was the inspiration, not the model. This is a smaller and narrower
thing, built around HUMINT case work rather than cyber threat intelligence —
no STIX bundles, no observables. People, places, organizations, and the
reports and relationships that tie them together.

**Everything runs on your hardware.** Postgres, the API, the worker and —
if you want extraction — Ollama, all in Docker Compose on one machine. No
account, no cloud service, no telemetry. It is comfortable on a Raspberry Pi
4 without the model, and wants more memory with one.

> **Beta.** This is being tested by a small group. It works, it is tested
> (72 automated suites, API and browser), and it is not yet something to
> stake a real operation on. See [Deliberate limitations](docs/DESIGN.md#deliberate-limitations-read-before-relying-on-this-for-anything-important).

## Quick start

You need Docker and Docker Compose. Nothing else.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xPirate/humint-platform.git
cd humint-platform
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set POSTGRES_PASSWORD to something real.
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The first screen asks you to create the admin
account — there are no default credentials, and the first account made is the
admin.

That is the whole install. The step-by-step version, including running it on
a Pi, putting it behind HTTPS, and turning on the optional model, is
[How to install and run it for the first time](docs/how-to/install.md).

## What it does

**Eight kinds of entity.** Person, Organization, Location, Event, Source,
Communication, Vehicle and Record — each with fields that actually belong to it (a
Person's aliases and disposition, a Source's A–F reliability rating, a
Location's address and auto-geocoded coordinates, a Vehicle's make, plate and
body style, a Record's full text). Not a generic "object" with a bag of key/values.

**Documents that become part of the case.** An uploaded letter, statement or
registration printout can be saved as a **Record**: an entity holding the
document's full text, linked to the people and places it mentions, with the
original file attached. It sits on the network and on every linked page like
anything else.

**Alignment on the things that take sides.** People, organizations, sources
and vehicles carry Friendly / Neutral / Unknown / Hostile. A named group is an
entity of its own, so an individual aligned Friendly can belong to an
organization aligned Hostile — and a source can be Hostile and still grade A,
because whose side they are on and how good their reporting is are different
questions. Locations get an environment instead: permissive through denied,
because ground does not take a side.

**A network you can arrange.** Drag any dot in the relationship network and
it stays where you put it while the rest makes room; double-click to release
it, Refit to start over. The layout keeps drifting gently after it settles, and
stops when the tab is hidden or the pane is off screen.

**Drop a pin, get the address — and a guess at the business.** Clicking the
map reverse-geocodes the point and lists the named places within about a block,
nearest first, so "somewhere on Boston Avenue" becomes a candidate list you
pick from. Every candidate shows how far from your pin it actually is, because
a match two doors down looks identical to a correct one. If a Location is
already recorded within 50m it says so before you make a second record for the
same building. Works degraded and says so when there is no network.

**Feeds that do not fill your case file.** RSS items land on a Feeds page and
stop there. Read them, send the ones that matter to Documents — which fetches
the linked article, not just the feed's one-paragraph summary — and dismiss the
rest. From there they take the ordinary route: the worker reads the document,
extraction proposes records, you accept them in Review. Nothing from a feed
becomes part of the case until somebody puts it there. Unread items are cleared
on a schedule you set per feed.

**Reports from the field, on a write-only credential.** Enroll a phone in Admin
settings and it gets a token that can **send** a field report and nothing
else — the same token is refused by every read endpoint in the app. What
arrives waits in a queue under Review, sorted by how urgent the sender said
it was, until somebody accepts it as a draft report or sets it aside. A
device's code can be shown again at any time — which issues a fresh one,
since the console only ever kept a hash — and printed as a card to keep.

**An Android app to write them on.** Seven forms — signal, person, vehicle,
SALUTE activity, DF bearing, place, quick note — with photos, video and voice
memos, written offline and queued on the handset, encrypted. The app does not
hold the console's address or its token: those are scanned off a QR at the
moment of upload and wiped when it finishes, so a phone that is lost or seized
gives up the reports still on it and no route to anything else. No Google Play
Services anywhere in it, so it runs on a de-Googled handset. Pinch and
double-tap zoom, tap to focus, flash off unless you ask for it, **Add image**
for a screenshot of something seen on a screen, and from 1.6 a **Route**
recorder that runs with the screen off and an **Area** form that marks an edge
corner by corner. A signed APK (about
18 MB, Android 10 or later) is on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/xPirate/humint-platform/releases/latest)
with its SHA-256 in the notes, and a Google Play listing is on the way so
handsets can skip the sideloading warnings —
[how to publish it](docs/how-to/release-the-field-app.md). Source, build
instructions and how to verify the download are in
[`android/`](android/README.md).

**Accepting one can start the record it describes.** A vehicle sighting offers
a Vehicle with the plate, colour, make and model already in it; a person report
offers a Person; a place offers a Location at the phone's coordinates. Every
photo and clip from the report goes onto that record too, the first photo as
its portrait. Ticked by default, because not retyping a plate is the point — and still a draft, and
still somebody's decision.

**Link-finding you can switch on for ten minutes.** The no-model pass that
proposes relationships from shared surnames, addresses and contact details is
toggled from the Admin page rather than a config file — on, off, or on for a
set time after which it switches itself off. There is a Run-one-pass-now
button, because the point is to look at what it finds and then stop.

**Three optional boards, switched on per team.** A **Roster** of cards for the
people on the team — portrait, callsign, role — each opening their record. A
**BOLO** board for anything to recognise on sight, of any type, carrying what
to do about it and how urgent it is. And **Priorities**: the standing
questions, ranked, with the concrete things that would count as an answer. All
three are off until an admin turns one on, and each is named whatever the team
calls it, because a homicide file and a radio direction-finding net want
completely different pages.

**A file that can be kept over years.** Set, per record type, how long
something may sit untouched before the app archives it. "Untouched" counts
relationships, reports and documents, not just edits; records are flagged with
a visible date before anything happens; anyone can mark a record **Keep
indefinitely**; and nothing is ever deleted — archived records keep everything
and come back with one click. Preview shows what a policy would do to your
actual file before you save it.

**A click on a dot answers "who is that?"** — a card beside it with the type,
the alias, the alignment, the fields that identify that kind of record and the
nearest connections. Open the record from the card when you want it; reading
the shape of the file no longer costs two page loads per question.

**Right-click any record.** A menu of what to do about it: ask the assistant
about it, have the model look for links it might have, find records that read
like it (aliases, second files on the same person), add a relationship, start a
report, export a dossier. The model-backed items grey out with a reason when
Ollama is off.

**Relationships you can argue with — and that can lapse.** Every link is
graded 1–6 on the same credibility scale as reporting (1 confirmed … 6 cannot
be judged), with a discovery date and notes, all editable in place. Nothing
the machine proposes arrives better than *3 — possibly true*. A link can carry
an expiry date — the car parked outside last week — after which it stays on
both records, faded and marked expired, but leaves the network unless you ask
to see it.

**Reports that point at records.** Write a report, @-mention the entities it
discusses, and the link is made both ways. Reports carry a credibility rating
and a precedence (Flash / Immediate / Priority / Routine), and export to PDF.

**Packages you can hand to someone outside.** Export any record as a target
package or dossier that stands on its own: a cover with the portrait,
identifiers and who it was prepared for and why; the record in full; every
connection, graded; a timeline; every report that mentions it, in full, with
photographs. Built for passing a file to a police unit or a regulator. The
BOLO board prints as a "most wanted" sheet — six to a page or one per page,
with your own line on every sheet.

**The team, without putting the team in the case file.** Every analyst has a
profile — callsign, role, as many contact methods as they use (radio,
Meshtastic, MeshCore, email, a mobile, a social handle) and a status: at
liberty, under duress, incapacitated, captured, deceased. Status changes are
stamped and audited. Search by analyst opens a page of everything one person
has entered. Admins reset passwords from the Users list.

**A document inbox.** Drop in a PDF, image, `.docx` or text file. The worker
OCRs it if it needs OCR, then — if you have a model — proposes the entities
and relationships it found. Every proposal lands in a review queue with the
evidence attached. Nothing is written to the case file until you say so.

**Two review queues, no autopilot.** Extraction proposes records from
documents; correlation proposes that two records are the same thing. Both
are queues of suggestions with a reason you can check, never automatic
writes.

**Merging.** Five copies of one person, or an address split into a street, a
town and a postcode, fold into one record. Everything that pointed at the
losers points at the survivor; the losers are archived with a pointer to
where they went, so old exports and audit entries still resolve.

**A relationship network.** The whole case file as a picture, with the dots
graded by how many relationships each record has, so the thing everything
points at is obvious. Drawn by the app itself — no CDN, works offline.

**Records from the document you are reading.** The model misses things — a
byline, a company named once in passing. Select the name in the document text
and record it there, with the sentence it came from kept as evidence.

**Maps that work with the network unplugged.** Register a tile source, drag a
box over the ground you care about, and download it while you still have a
connection. After that the map is served from your own machine. ATAK map
source files import directly, satellite imagery included. Leaflet is served by
the app, not a CDN, so the map always loads.

**Routes and zones you can hand to ATAK.** A Route is a record with a line:
drawn on the map as a plan, walked with the field app's recorder (with the
time at every point), or imported from KML, KMZ or GPX alongside areas and
waypoints. Every zone is a record too, so a contested area can be linked to
the organisations holding it and the events inside it. Export any of it back
out as KML, KMZ or GPX, print the map view as a one-page PDF with scale and
coordinates, and target packages carry a map of the record and its linked
places.

**Zones, like a NOTAM.** Draw an area, say how workable it is, and put a clock
on it. A protest that turns from semi-permissive to non-permissive is one edit
and a note saying why — kept as a timeline, not an overwrite. When the clock
runs out the zone dims rather than vanishing, and the reports written while it
was running stay gathered under its Event.

**A place a source can point at.** In a guided debrief, somebody who cannot
give you an address can very often point at the roof. The pin becomes a
Location record — with real coordinates — when the report is filed, and
nothing at all if the debrief is abandoned.

**An audit trail.** Every write, who did it and from where, with optional
syslog forwarding. Whole-instance backup and restore as a single zip. Admins
can delete noise permanently, previewed and audited; everyone else archives.

**A local model, optionally.** Point it at an Ollama instance — the bundled
container or one you already run — and it does extraction, embeddings for
duplicate detection, and an assistant that can only see your case file.
Without a model, everything except extraction still works, and the signal
pass still proposes links using plain SQL over what you have entered.

## Screens

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Dashboard](docs/images/dashboard.png) **Dashboard** — what needs attention, computed from your own records, no model involved. | ![Entity detail](docs/images/entity-detail.png) **A record** — its details, contacts, neighbourhood and every report that mentions it. |
| ![Documents](docs/images/documents.png) **Documents** — the inbox: drop a file in, watch it go from *waiting* to *read*, see what was pulled out of it. The one that failed says why. | ![Review](docs/images/review.png) **Review** — proposals with their confidence and their source. Nothing here is in the case file yet. |

**A document, and what was proposed from it.** The text on the left is what
was read out of the file; the cards on the right are what a model thought was
in it. Each one is accepted or dismissed by a person, and *Find in text*
shows you the sentence it came from before you decide.

![A document open beside the entities and the relationship proposed from it](docs/images/document-review.png)

**Light and dark.** The same screen, the same case file, both palettes. Dark
is the phosphor-green this tool has always used; light exists because
green-on-black is unreadable outdoors in daylight. The switch is in the
account menu and follows your operating system if you let it.

## Requirements

|  | Without a model | With a local model |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| RAM | 2 GB | 8 GB for a 7–8B model, more for larger |
| Disk | 5 GB + your attachments | 5 GB + the model (4–40 GB) |
| Tested on | Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB), x86 Linux, macOS | x86 Linux with and without a GPU |

The model does not need a GPU. It is slower without one, and nothing in the
app waits on it — extraction runs in a background worker, never on the
request path.

## Security, briefly

This is built to run on a network you control, and it assumes that. Sessions
are cookie-based, passwords are hashed, every write is audited, and uploads
are handled carefully — but **there is no multi-tenancy and no per-record
access control**. Everyone with an account sees the whole case file. Put it
behind a VPN or a reverse proxy with TLS, not on the open internet.

Full posture, including what is deliberately not defended against, is in
[the design notes](docs/DESIGN.md#security-posture).

## Reporting problems

Open an issue. Useful ones include what you did, what happened, what you
expected, and the relevant lines from `docker compose logs api` or
`docker compose logs worker`.

**Scrub your case data first.** Log lines and screenshots from a real file
contain real names. If the bug needs data to reproduce, please reproduce it
with invented data — the exercise set in `docs/exercise/` is there for
exactly this.
