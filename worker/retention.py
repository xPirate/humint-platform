"""Retention: archiving records that nobody has touched for a long time.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A case file has an end. A living team file does not, and without something
like this a record entered two years ago and never looked at since sits in
every list, every search and every network with exactly the same weight as
the one entered this morning. The instance does not break; it just gets
quietly less useful every year, which is harder to notice and harder to fix.

WHAT IT DOES

Per entity type, an administrator sets how many days a record may sit with no
activity. A sweep (worker/main.py, once an hour) finds records past that
window and flags them with a visible "due to be archived on ..." date. If the
grace period also passes with no activity, the sweep archives them.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

It never deletes. Archiving sets is_active FALSE, which the app already
understands: the record keeps its relationships, its reports and its
documents, stays searchable behind "Show archived", still resolves from an
old export or audit entry, and comes back with one click. Permanent deletion
remains what it was — an admin typing a confirmation into api/destroy.py.

It also never touches event_details.expires_at, which is a different idea
wearing a similar word. That field is the analyst saying "this stops
mattering on the 14th", and the app deliberately does nothing with it but
draw a badge. This module is the opposite direction: the app noticing that
nobody has been near a record, and saying so before acting.

WHAT "TOUCHED" MEANS

Not "edited". A person nobody has opened in two years but who was named in a
report last week is not idle, and archiving them would be obviously wrong to
anyone who looked. LAST_ACTIVITY_SQL below is the whole definition: the
latest of the record's own updated_at, any relationship at either end, any
report that names it, and any document attached to it.

THE THREE EXEMPTIONS

A hold on the record (an analyst pointing at it and saying "not this one"),
optionally anything still linked to an active record, and optionally anything
assessed Hostile. The second is the dangerous one — in a well-linked file it
can spare nearly everything — which is why the Admin page counts what each
exemption would spare before the policy is saved rather than afterwards.

This file is duplicated byte-identical in api/ and worker/. Every function
takes a cursor rather than opening one, so the same code runs inside a
request and inside the poll loop.
