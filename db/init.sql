-- entered in 2024 and never looked at again is as present in every list,
-- every search and every network as the one entered this morning, and the

--   1. It archives, it never deletes. An archived record keeps its
--      relationships, its reports and its documents, stays searchable behind
--      "Show archived", and comes back with one click.
--   2. It warns first. A record is flagged as due, and only archived when the
--      grace period has also passed with no activity.
--   3. "Untouched" means untouched by anything, not merely unedited -- see
--      LAST_ACTIVITY_SQL in api/retention.py. A person nobody has edited in
--      two years but who was named in a report last week is not idle.

-- A row per type, rather than one number for the whole app, because the types

-- Ollama call log

-- One row per call to Ollama, from either the api or the worker.
--
-- This is NOT a billing ledger. A self-hosted model costs nothing per token;
-- what it costs is time on one machine that everything else is queued behind.
-- So the columns that matter here are the durations and the outcome, and the
-- token counts are mostly useful as the denominator that turns a duration
-- into a rate you can compare between models.
--
-- Three questions it exists to answer, in the order people ask them:
--
--   Is it working at all?      outcome + error. A model that has quietly
--                              started timing out on every extraction looks
--                              exactly like an empty queue from the outside,
--                              and that is the failure this table is most
--                              worth having for.
--   What is it spent on?       operation + user_id. Contention on a single
--                              GPU is real: one person's chat habit can be
--                              why the extraction queue is not moving.
--   Is this box keeping up?    eval_tokens / eval_duration_ms is tokens per
--                              second, and load_duration_ms separates "the
--                              model was cold" from "the model is slow",
