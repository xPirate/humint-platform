/**
 * The queue, on disk, encrypted.
 *
 * A report exists here from the moment the analyst starts typing. Nothing is
 * held only in memory and lost when the phone is put in a pocket and the
 * process is killed — which, on a modern Android, is most times.
 *
 * [clientRef] is generated once, when the draft is created, and never
 * changes. It is what makes a retry idempotent on the console: an upload
 * interrupted after the server committed but before the app heard back
 * resends the same ref and lands as the same report. This is the single most
 * important field in the schema and the reason it is a UUID assigned at
 * draft time rather than at upload time.
