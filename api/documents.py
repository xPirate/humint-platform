"""The inbox: documents dropped in before anyone knows what is in them.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Every other way into this app asks you to know the answer first. Creating an
entity asks who. Writing a report asks what happened. Attaching a file asks
which record it belongs to. But the job usually starts the other way round —
a PDF, a photographed noticeboard, a forwarded message arrives, and the whole
question is *who is in this*. Until this view existed, the only way to get a
document into the extraction pipeline was to first invent a record to hang it
off, which meant creating the thing you were trying to find out about.

WHAT A DOCUMENT IS

An `attachments` row with no report_id and no entity_id. Not a new table, not
a parallel pipeline — the same row, claimed by the same worker loop, OCR'd by
the same code, read by the same model, proposing into the same review queue.
The only thing that makes it a "document" is that nobody has filed it yet.

That is why this module is short. It is a view and a few verbs over a table
that already did all of this; the feature was one CHECK constraint away the
whole time.

FILING IT LATER

`POST /{id}/file-under` sets the parent, at which point the row stops being a
document and starts being that record's attachment. Nothing is copied and
nothing is re-extracted — the extracted text, the proposals already made from
it, and the file on disk all follow it across, because they were never
anywhere else.
