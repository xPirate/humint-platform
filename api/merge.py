"""Folding duplicate records into one.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Extraction produces duplicates. The same person is named four ways across six
documents; a single address arrives as a street, a town and a postcode because
the model read them as three places. The correlation queue has always been able
to *say* two records look like the same thing, but confirming that only
recorded an opinion — the analyst still had to reassign every relationship,
report link and attachment by hand, which nobody does, so the file fills up
with near-duplicates instead.

WHAT A MERGE IS

One survivor, one or more records folded into it, and everything that pointed
at the losers now points at the survivor. The losers are archived, not deleted,
and each carries a pointer to where it went — history references them (an old
report link, last month's exported PDF, an audit entry) and a dead end is worse
than a redirect.

THE FIELD RULE

The survivor wins. Any field it left blank is filled from the losers, in the
order they were given. This is deliberately not a field-by-field negotiation:
with five copies of the same record that is a lot of clicking to reach an
obvious answer, and anything the merge gets wrong is editable afterwards like
any other record. What it will never do is overwrite something the survivor
already says.

WHAT MAKES THIS FIDDLY

Not the reassignment — that is a handful of UPDATEs. It is the edges:

  * A relationship between two records being merged becomes a self-edge, which
    is meaningless and which the schema forbids. It is dropped.
  * Two records that both relate to a third the same way produce a duplicate
    edge. Deduplicated, keeping the one with the most information on it.
  * report_entities and contact_points can collide on their own keys.
  * The correlation table stores ids as plain text with no foreign key, so
    nothing cascades and its rows have to be rewritten by hand — including the
    pair that prompted the merge, which resolves itself.
  * The survivor's embedding is now stale, because its text has changed. It is
    cleared so the worker recomputes it; leaving it would keep proposing the
    old duplicates.

CROSSING KINDS

Normally a merge refuses records of different kinds, because the survivor's
kind decides what the merged record IS and quietly changing that is not
something an interface should do behind your back. But it does happen that
extraction files one company as both a Person and an Organization, and then
one of those two records is simply wrong.

So it is allowed, on two conditions: the caller passes `allow_type_change`
explicitly, and the interface says first what it costs. The cost is specific
— each kind's fields live in its own table, so a Person folded into an
Organization loses its date of birth, its aliases and its physical
description, because organization_details has nowhere to put them. Everything
that is not kind-specific — the name, relationships, reports, attachments,
contacts, the description — moves across as it always does.
