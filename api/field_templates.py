"""The shapes a field report can take, and what the console does with one.

`field_templates.json` beside this file is the contract; this module is the
console's half of it. The companion app ships a byte-identical copy of that
JSON compiled into its assets, because a handset is off-network until the
moment it uploads and cannot fetch anything.

The rule running through all of it: **a field report is never refused over its
shape.** An unknown template, a field key that was renamed two versions ago, a
value of a type nobody expected — every one of those renders as best it can
and is flagged for the person working the queue. Somebody stood outside and
typed that in. Losing it because a string arrived where a number was expected
would be the worst bug this feature could have.
