"""Bulk entity import via CSV: download a per-type template, fill it in,
upload it back. Meant for exactly the case a single "+ New Entity" form is
bad at — adding a dozen (or a hundred) People/Organizations/Locations at
once from a list you already have somewhere else.

Deliberately reuses entities.py's own DETAIL_TABLES/DETAIL_MODELS/
_parsed_details/_insert_details rather than re-declaring per-type field
lists here — that dict is the single source of truth for what each entity
type's fields are, and a template or an import path that drifted from it
would be a worse bug than the coupling is worth. Row-level validation goes
through the exact same Pydantic models the single-entity POST /api/entities
endpoint uses, so a row that would be rejected there is rejected here with
the same message, not a second, possibly-inconsistent set of rules.

Partial success, not all-or-nothing: unlike every other write endpoint in
this app (one HTTP request = one atomic change), an import is dozens or
hundreds of logically independent rows. Aborting the whole upload because
row 47 had a typo would mean re-uploading everything, including the 46 good
rows, after every single fix. Instead each row gets its own commit; a
csv the analyst can fix one row at a time. This is the one place in the
codebase that manages its own transactions per-row instead of using
db.db_cursor's one-transaction-per-request pattern, and it's why.
