"""Entity + relationship CRUD.

Fixed core entity types (see db/init.sql for the reasoning): person,
organization, location, event, source, communication, vehicle, record. Each type's
distinguishing fields live in a 1:1 "detail" table; DETAIL_TABLES below is
the single source of truth mapping a type to its table and column list, so
every dynamic-SQL helper here reads from one place instead of duplicating
the mapping per endpoint.

Entities are archived (is_active = false), never hard-deleted — relationships,
reports, and attachments may reference them and that history should survive.
Relationships ARE hard-deleted: an edge is a much smaller, more mechanical
fact than an entity, and there is no cross-table history hanging off a
relationship row the way there is off an entity.
