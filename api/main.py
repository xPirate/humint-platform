    Without one, the browser gets a file carrying only Last-Modified and

    asking the server anything. On a long-lived deployment that arithmetic
    grows without bound — a file last changed three months ago is treated
    as fresh for about a week — so an upgraded app.js can go unnoticed by a
    browser that has been using the app for a while. The symptom is
    particularly nasty: index.html is a navigation document and gets
    revalidated, so the new markup arrives and the new buttons appear,
    while the script that makes them work does not. "no-cache" does not
    mean "don't cache" — it means "always ask first", so the browser still
    keeps the file and still gets a cheap 304 when nothing has changed.
