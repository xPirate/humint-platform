"""Actions offered on a single record from the right-click menu.

Everything here starts from "I am looking at this record and want the app to do
one thing about it." The two that need a model are separated from the rest so
the menu can grey them out rather than fail when Ollama is off.

Nothing here writes to `relationships` or edits a record. Finding similar
records is a read; flagging a duplicate writes a *suggestion* into the review
queue, the same row the worker's correlation pass writes, and a person still
decides. That is the same promise the extraction and propose paths make.
