"""Whole-instance backup and restore.

Two admin-only endpoints: GET /api/admin/backup downloads a .zip of
everything, POST /api/admin/restore replaces everything with the contents of
one of those zips. Built for two jobs — moving a deployment to another
machine (a Pi, a new laptop, a rebuilt server) and getting back to a known
state without re-typing a case by hand.

WHAT'S IN A BACKUP

Every table in the `public` schema except `sessions`, discovered from
information_schema at backup time rather than hardcoded here. That's
deliberate: a hardcoded table list is one forgotten line away from a backup
that silently omits a whole feature's data, and you'd only find out on the
day you actually needed to restore it. Discovery means a table added later is
included automatically, with no maintenance here and no silent gap.

That includes `users` — usernames, roles, and bcrypt password hashes — so
people can log in on the restored instance with the passwords they already
have. It means a backup file is as sensitive as the database itself; see
"Backup and restore" in README.md.

`sessions` is the sole exclusion, and it's excluded in both directions: never
written to a backup, and always wiped on restore. Restoring a different
users table underneath live session rows would leave tokens pointing at user
ids that now belong to someone else entirely — so everyone, including the
admin who just clicked Restore, logs in again afterward.

Uploaded files are bundled as real files under uploads/ in the zip, keyed by
their storage_path, so a restored instance has working documents/images
rather than rows pointing at files that aren't there. Which rows have a file
behind them is worked out from the columns -- any table with a storage_path --
rather than from a list of table names here, because the prune at the end of
a restore removes whatever this does not name.

WHY JSON AND NOT pg_dump

pg_dump would be more faithful and less code, but it needs the postgres
client binaries in the api image, ties a backup to a Postgres major version,
and can't be restored from inside the running app without dropping the schema
out from under the very connection doing the work. A JSON payload is
inspectable (open data.json and read it), portable across Postgres versions,
and restorable inside one ordinary transaction — which is what makes the
safety property below possible.

THE SAFETY PROPERTY

A restore wipes real data, so the entire DB half runs in ONE transaction:
TRUNCATE every table, re-insert, reset sequences, commit. Postgres makes
TRUNCATE transactional, so any failure anywhere in that block — a bad row, a
constraint violation, a dropped connection — rolls the whole thing back and
leaves the existing data exactly as it was. There is deliberately no
half-restored state to recover from.

Attachment files can't participate in that transaction, so they're handled
around it: the zip is fully validated before anything is touched, files are
extracted to a staging directory inside UPLOAD_DIR (same filesystem, so
moving them into place afterward is a rename, not a copy), and they're only
moved into place after the database transaction has committed.
