"""Case-data-aware AI assistant — the app-wide side panel (see the "AI
Assistant" section of README.md).

This is deliberately NOT a general-purpose chatbot bolted onto the app: every
question is answered only from a small bundle of case data ("context")
retrieved fresh for that specific question, handed to Ollama as an
extra-strength system prompt alongside the running conversation. The design
question this module answers is "what goes in that bundle, and how is it
found" — see build_context() below.

Retrieval has two tiers, chosen per-question, not per-deployment:

1. Embedding similarity, when OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL is configured. The question
   itself is embedded via the same Ollama embed endpoint worker/correlate.py
   already uses to embed entities/reports for the correlation queue, then
   compared (plain-Python cosine similarity, same math as correlate.py) against
   every already-embedded entity/report. This is the good path: it can surface
   a relevant record even when the question doesn't share any exact words with
   it.
2. Keyword fallback, used whenever tier 1 isn't available (no embed model
   configured) or simply turns up nothing above the similarity floor. Plain
   ILIKE matching of the question's meaningful words against entity
   name/description and report title/body, ranked by how many distinct
   keywords matched. Cruder, but means the assistant still works in the very
   common deployment shape where extraction/chat is configured but a separate
   embedding model was never pulled (embeddings are a second, optional model
   pull — see "Which model, and how it's configured" in README.md).

Either way, once a shortlist of entity/report ids is chosen, the actual
context text reuses entities.get_entity() / reports._report_dict() — the same
functions the regular detail-view endpoints use — rather than re-querying
those tables from scratch, so the assistant always sees exactly the same
shape of data (details, relationships, linked reports) an analyst would see
by clicking into that record themselves.

Nothing here ever writes to entities/relationships/reports — same review-
queue-free but still read-only spirit as the dashboard and map endpoints.
The only writes this module makes are to assistant_messages, which is purely
a per-user conversation log, not case data.
