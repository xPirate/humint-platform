"""Report export: a formatted PDF intel package.

Exports one report as a self-contained document an analyst can hand to
someone who doesn't have access to this app — the report itself, plus the
case context that makes it readable on its own: a dossier for every entity
it's linked to, the photos attached to those entities, and its own
attachments. The point is that the recipient shouldn't have to ask "who is
R. Okonjo?" halfway down page two.

WHY REPORTLAB

The obvious alternative is HTML-to-PDF (WeasyPrint, wkhtmltopdf), which gives
prettier output for less layout code. Both need system libraries — pango and
cairo, or a bundled Chromium — and this app is expected to run on a Raspberry
Pi, where every apt dependency is image size and another thing that can fail
to build on arm. ReportLab is pure pip with no system packages at all, so the
export works anywhere the api container already runs.

FONTS

ReportLab's default Helvetica is Latin-1 only: a Cyrillic name, a Greek
letter, or even a stray typographic dash renders as a black box, silently, in
a document that's supposed to be a deliverable. So this registers a real
Unicode TTF at import, preferring DejaVu (installed in the api image, see the
Dockerfile) and falling back to the Bitstream Vera fonts ReportLab bundles.
Only if neither is loadable does it fall back to Helvetica, and in that case
text is transliterated rather than allowed to render as boxes — see
_sanitize_for_builtin_font.
