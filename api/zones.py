"""Map zones: an area, an assessment of it, and a clock.

The NOTAM idea. Somewhere is different from normal, for a while, and anyone
opening the map should see that without reading a report first — a protest, a
cordon, a stretch of road nobody should be on tonight.

Three things make this more than a coloured shape:

  * **It is not a Location.** A Location is a place that exists. A zone is a
    judgement about ground over a period, and the same ground can carry
    several at once. Storing it on the Location record would mean editing the
    town to say its square was briefly dangerous.

  * **It changes, and the changes are the point.** A protest that goes
    semi-permissive to non-permissive at 18:40 is the finding. Every change is
    kept as case material on the zone itself, not only in the audit log —
    an analyst should not have to ask an admin to read their own timeline.

  * **Expiry does not delete.** An expired zone stops being drawn as live and
    stays exactly where it was, still attached to its Event and to every
    report written while it was running. "Where was the cordon that night" is
    asked weeks later.

Since v1.9 every zone is also a **Zone record** (an entity of type 'zone'),
so a contested area can be linked to the organisations holding it, the events
inside it and the reports about it, and is found by search, drawn on the
network and carried into packages like anything else. map_zones stays its
detail table: the geometry, the assessment, the clock and the timeline. The
record's name and description are the zone's name and notes; this module
keeps the copy in map_zones in step.

Geometry is GeoJSON in JSONB and point-in-polygon is done here, in Python,
rather than by adding PostGIS. The ray-casting test below is twenty lines and
runs against a bounding-box shortlist; an extension would put a migration
between a user and `docker compose up` for arithmetic this app can do itself.
