"""Report authoring and attachment upload.

Reports are the analyst-written case narrative — markdown body, linked to
whichever entities it discusses, with document/image evidence attached
either to the report itself or directly to an entity (e.g. a mugshot on a
Person). Deletion policy is intentionally asymmetric between the two:

  * Reports have no DELETE endpoint of their own. A bad report is corrected
    by editing it or leaving it in 'draft' status, not removed — case
    write-ups are exactly the kind of thing you don't want silently
    disappearing. Permanent removal exists only as an admin action via
    destroy.py, which previews exactly what goes, requires typed
    confirmation, and writes the result to the audit log.
  * Attachments DO support delete — uploading the wrong file is a much more
    mechanical mistake than writing a wrong report — and deleting one also
    removes the underlying file from disk, not just the DB row, since a
    stray, unlisted file has no value once nothing references it.
